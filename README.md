 a predictive model that estimates future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for various industry sectors or organizations, using historical emission records and influential economic factors. 
for the problem stament "Problem Statement:
You have annual supply chain emission data from 2010â€“2016 categorized into industries and commodities. The goal is to develop a regression model that can predict the Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins based on descriptive and quality metrics (substance, unit, reliability, temporal/geographical/technological/data collection correlations, etc.)."
the model used is XGBoost having MSE value 0.95 on predicted data and also visually represented outcome of the mdel build using XGBoost.
